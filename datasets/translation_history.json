        "English": "By the time Mami reached the theatre, she had changed her entire appearance.\nMost of the disguise was quite trivial. It was simple to ask her hair to drop down into a relaxed conformation—she was extremely thankful she no longer had to do her hair every morning—simple to transform her soul gem into a less standard bracelet, and also simple to dismiss her *personal* transport in a secluded area and instead board a civilian‐standard model.",
        "Chinese": "当麻美走到电影院的时候，她的样子已经和刚才完全不同了。\n她的伪装其实很简单。给头发下指令将发型改为自然下垂——不用亲手做头发真是爽——把灵魂宝石变形成一种比较少见的手镯形态，然后把自己的专车停在一个隐蔽地点，换乘一辆标准民用车。"

        "English": "If only she could grab a hooded coat out of a clothing supplier and then be done with it.\nUnfortunately, in this age of ubiquitous facial recognition, that simply wouldn't be enough.",
        "Chinese": "要是能够套一件连帽大衣解决问题就完美了。\n可惜，在人脸识别大行其道的当下，连帽大衣已经成为历史了。"

        "English": "Thus, she was obliged to walk into the theatre with a miniature holoemitter stuck to the side of her cheek, one capable of distorting her appearance to that of someone else who lived in the area, someone who vaguely resembled the famous Marshal Mami, but obviously wasn't. Another one stuck to her finger concealed the tell‐tale flower fingernail mark.",
        "Chinese": "所以，在走到电影院的路上，她往脸上粘了一个微型全息投影仪，借此把自己的外貌扭曲成了一个住在附近的其他人——长得有点像著名的麻美元帅，但明显不是本人。粘在手指上的另一个投影仪隐藏了花朵型的指甲纹 (另一个明显的魔法少女标志)。"

    {
        "English": "It was widely known that the government granted exceptions to the regulations against identity disguise, but that didn't make her disguise any less effective. Sure, she wouldn't fool any of the surveillance monitors, but it was more than sufficient to mislead the casual inspection of passerby. And the monitors knew not to attract anyone's attention to her.",
        "Chinese": "很多人都知道她持有执政体颁发的个人身份伪装许可，但这并不影响这种扮装的效果。这种程度显然骗不过监控摄像头，但是用来误导路人们不经意的视线已经足够了。摄像头们当然也很知趣，不会随便拆穿她。"

    {
        "English": "She had considered showing up dressed for the occasion, picturing herself stepping out of the nighttime lights into the brightness of the theatre in a stunning dress, and wearing the face of someone *particularly* attractive, but in the end had decided against it. Turning heads in her direction would be risky, even if she had an urge to have people do it for reasons other than \"It's Mami‐san!\"",
        "Chinese": "她也考虑过，要不要选个漂亮点儿的脸，再换件衣服。她想象了一下自己身着华服从昏暗的街灯下步入灯火通明的电影院的感觉，最后还是放弃了。虽然她很希望偶尔能用 “这是麻美！” 以外的理由吸引到路人回头，但这种引人注目的行动太冒险了。"
    },
    {
        "English": "Besides, other than being puerile by trying to grab attention, what would be the point? She had stayed relationship‐free her entire life—a number of years she didn't like to think about—and didn't see it as a good idea to change that anytime soon.",
        "Chinese": "反正，这也就能满足一下自己幼稚的表现欲吧？她一辈子都没有谈过恋爱——她已经不敢计算具体的年份数字了——而且现在也不打算改变这一点。"

    {
        "English": "So she showed up in the theatre dressed in the exact same clothes she had worn before, a stylish but nondescript blouse and skirt. Around her, couples and groups chatted, nearly all dressed better than her. She frowned. Ironically, she might attract attention for being too *poorly* dressed.",
        "Chinese": "所以她穿着和刚才完全一样的衣服进了电影院——衬衫配裙子，入时但不过分显眼。在她周围，成双成对的情侣们和成群结队的朋友们各自闲聊着，几乎每个人都穿得比她好。她有些郁闷。不无讽刺地，她穿得这么普通可能反而更加引人注目。"

        "English": "It would be a chilly night, she thought to herself, checking her chronometer. 18:30.\nOnce, long ago, that would have forced everyone to show up in jackets and heavier clothing. As a magical girl, she had always been carefully aware of things like that. Once you realized the degree to which it was possible to manipulate your own body, it was startlingly easy to forget yourself and just walk everywhere in the same clothing, mindless of the temperature.",
        "Chinese": "夜里其实很冷，她想着，查询了一下内置时计。六点半。\n很久以前，在这种气温下人们会需要穿得厚一点，或者加一件外套。作为魔法少女，她总是特别留意这种事。当你发现了自己新身体的 “调节范围” 之后，很容易就会下意识地忽略掉气温的变化，然后走到哪里都穿着同一身衣服。"

        "Chinese": "她站定脚步，欣赏着大厅里巨大的全息人像。\n中间站着的是故事的主角，焰。她表情坚定，手中的弓箭燃烧着紫色的火焰。投影装置的设计使得无论你站在大厅何处，箭矢的方向总是正对着你。"
    },
    {
        "English": "To her right, Kyouko stood, spear drawn and pointed aggressively, crouching in combat posture. In the sort of detail that biographers always missed, Kyouko did *not* have any food in her mouth or with her.",
        "Chinese": "在她右边的是战斗姿态的杏子，长矛摆着架势，身体半蹲，蓄势待发。作为传记作家们常常忘记的一个细节，杏子嘴里没有叼着任何食物，也没在身上揣着。"
    },
    {
        "English": "Behind Kyouko, Yuma stood, blunt mace at her feet, looking up wondrously at an imaginary sky. She was portrayed slightly younger than the others, even though that had stopped being accurate rather early.",
        "Chinese": "杏子背后是由真，脚边倚着大锤，仰望着虚幻的天空。她显得比其他人小一点，尽管这点年龄差距其实早就无关紧要了。"
    },
    {
        "English": "Above them all, in a cloud of white mist, you could almost make out the form of a girl, embracing them all. It was a nice touch, and entirely appropriate, Mami thought. It was a movie about *Homura's* life, after all, and her Goddess had clearly been real to her, if to no one else.",
        "Chinese": "在她们上方浮着一团白色的雾气，雾里一名少女的身影若隐若现，对所有人敞开着自己的怀抱。这个细节倒是做得不错，而且放在这里也很合适，麻美心想。毕竟这是描写小焰生活的电影。就算没有别人相信她的女神，至少对她本人来说，她是真实存在的吧。"
    },
    {
        "English": "And, of course, to Homura's left stood Mami herself, musket at attention on her shoulder, two more floating in the air pointed at imaginary targets. She looked regal.",
        "Chinese": "不出预料，小焰的左边是麻美本人，肩上架着一把火绳枪，身侧空中浮着另外两把。火枪瞄着虚幻的敌人，姿势显得很气派。"

    {
        "English": "Mami couldn't help but smile a little. Nowadays, computers carefully retouched the actors' faces and bodies so that they looked just like the originals, but they could never resist turning up the attractiveness just a little. Personally, Mami couldn't recall either Kyouko or Homura having chests *quite* that large, but she supposed she shouldn't begrudge a little pandering to the audience.",
        "Chinese": "麻美不禁露出了微笑。在这个时代，后期的电脑特效足以把演员们的身材面貌搞得和本人一模一样，但导演总是无法克制把大家弄漂亮一点的冲动。从个人角度说，麻美记得杏子和焰从来没有把胸部搞到那么大过，不过转念一想，她觉得自己倒也没必要和这种服务观众的行为较劲。"
    },
    {
        "English": "The movie industry definitely kept up with the latest technology, for what it was worth. For instance, given how much easier it was to do nowadays, it was now considered a point of professionalism for actors to become fluent in the language their characters spoke, and audiences were expected to use their language enhancements to keep up, if that language wasn't their own—though the lazier ones could activate a voiceover if they really wanted. It was a better experience to do it the harder way, however.",
        "Chinese": "电影业界的技术永远在更新换代。比如对于这个时代的演员来说，能够流利地使用所演角色的语言已经成了基本的职业要求 (毕竟这么做的难度已经大大降低了)。而非母语的观众则被建议使用自己的内置语言模块来进行辅助理解。当然，如果你懒得这么做，你还是可以切换到配音版，但这样做会降低影片的观感。"
    },
    {
        "English": "She moved on, avoiding the obvious temptation to just stand and stare, especially at herself. It would have been a little suspicious.",
        "Chinese": "她努力克制住了接着欣赏自己全息影像的冲动，继续向前走去。这么做会显得可疑的。"

        "English": "She glided past the entrance to the virtual reality version of the movie, even though, as a serving member of the military, it wouldn't have even cost her anything.",

    {
        "English": "She had gotten more than enough of the real thing.\nInstead, she stepped into the area for standard holographic viewing, the entrances to the various different rooms arrayed concentrically around a large, circular middle area with yet another concession stand in the middle.",
        "Chinese": "现实的魔法少女生活什么的，她已经体验得太多了。\n她转而走进了普通的 3D 放映区。无数个放映室的入口围成了一个圆圈，中间是一个食品柜台。"
    },
    {
        "English": "The food was free, but Mami didn't partake, instead stopping to ponder on whether she should go for a private room or try to have a more proletarian experience, as part of a group.",
        "Chinese": "食品是免费的，不过麻美没有点。她斗争着到底是要定一个单间，还是体验一次更加贴近群众的感觉：找一群人一起看。"

    {
        "English": "Suddenly, she realized that she was standing directly across from another customer, a woman with short, cropped hair, civilian‐standard age twenty‐seven or so. She looked similarly indecisive, and they looked at each other. Perhaps Mami would have someone to go with, after all.",
        "Chinese": "突然，她发现自己正对面有另一位客人同样也站住了，短头发，标准的二十七岁外表，看起来也在犹豫。麻美和她对视了一眼，感觉自己或许找到可以一起看的人了。"
    },
    {
        "English": "Mami opened her mouth to say something—\n—when a girl appeared at her side. She appeared nineteen, which meant she really *was* nineteen, since civilians all froze their apparent ages in their late twenties.",
        "Chinese": "但麻美正要开口的时候——\n——另一个女孩出现在了她的身边。她看上去差不多十九岁。这也就意味着她真的就是十九岁。因为民间人的外表年龄最早也只能固化在二十岁后半左右。"

    },
    {
        "English": "Mami glanced at the group behind her, who waved. Mami waved back, thinking about how strange it was that magical girls had developed the practice of maintaining the appearance of teenagers and, occasionally, children. Nowadays, it helped them stand out on the battlefield—and made them smaller targets—but its main purpose was as a show of solidarity.",
        "Chinese": "麻美看了一眼身后招手欢迎的女生小团体，也挥手回应。这不禁让她觉得魔法少女们保持青春期 (或者幼女) 外表的习俗有点奇怪。当然，现在这个习惯可以让她们在战场上更容易辨认，同时也能减小自己的目标。但这一行为的根本目的，终究还是彰显这个群体遗世独立的特殊地位。"

        "Chinese": "然后走过去加入了她们。\n她心里把自己狠狠地嘲笑了一通。\n我大概真的是看着有点寂寞吧，不是吗？她自嘲地想。而且我在这里装嫩的事情要是被杏子知道了的话……"

        "English": "Modern holotheatres were rather impressive affairs, straining at the utmost limits of what was possible without directly accessing a person's government‐restricted VR implants—which could only be done in the prohibitively‐expensive paid VR sections of the theatre. In an effect similar to that which had been done to the Homura statue at the entrance, every seat was given a view from what the director felt to be the optimal perspective, and, in a slight concession by the government, the theatre owners were allowed to use the VR implants to rotate a person's head for them, and to blink the eyes—this could be refused, but that was only recommended for a second viewing.",

    },
    {
        "English": "Besides that, scents were pumped into the room, sounds were funneled directly into the same intercranial systems used to process voice calls, and the ground itself shook when necessary. Antigravity and gravity generators throughout the walls—a serious luxury, given how rare antigrav was—changed the direction of gravity as needed relative to the viewer's head.",
        "Chinese": "这个时代的全息剧场其实相当的了不起，在挑战感官极限同时又不能触动官方的 VR 规制——那种服务只有在 VR 区花上一大笔费用才能享用。放映厅里使用了和入口的海报影像类似的手法，每个座位看到的都是导演指定的最佳视角。然后，作为执政体的一个小小让步，电影院可以通过 VR 接口来适当地调整观众的头部角度和眨眼时机。观众们可以选择拒绝，但导演建议不要在初次观影时这么做。"
    },
    {
        "English": "The line was drawn only at directly shaking or otherwise perturbing the viewer's chair—people didn't seem to like it.",
        "Chinese": "除了视觉享受之外，电影院还会向屋里输送对应的气味，向观众脑内的语音通信接口直接发送音频信号，并在必要的时候振动地面。墙上遍布的重力发生器和反重力装置随时准备着改变观众头部感知到的重力方向，但很神奇地，从没有观众因此摔过跤。"

        "English": "The main lights dimmed to darkness—a completely unnecessary effect that was mostly an homage to the past—and the four walls lit up with images that quickly seeped out into the air itself and solidified, until they became literally everything Mami could see, blocking out the people around her, the walls, her body, and even her nose. She granted the machine permission to access her auditory implants, and immediately her head filled with orchestral music. Seven girls clad in stolas danced around her, giggling, before their images dissolved and reformed in front of her to form… the logo of Seven Muses Technologies.",

    {
        "English": "In truth, it was easily possible to also block out the voices of the other members of the audience, but it was deliberately not done. What was the point of a group viewing if you were going to be isolated in a bubble the entire time? The whole point was so you could hear the reactions of those around you, in the form of \"oohs\" and \"aahs\". Extended commentary was usually not appreciated, however.",
        "Chinese": "没给你放十分钟广告就不错了，麻美默默吐槽道。"
    },
    {
        "English": "Despite the boy's complaints, the movie got to the point refreshingly fast, at least from Mami's antiquated perspective, pausing only to let all of them make their choices about whether to allow the movie to direct what they turned their head to look at. Mami went ahead and agreed. She was content to let the director take her wherever he or she wanted to.",
        "Chinese": "技术上，隔绝掉其他观众的声音其实很容易，但设计者故意没有这么做。要是每个人都封闭在自己的空间里的话，约别人一起看电影还有什么意义呢？这种设计让你能够听到周围人的感受，比如 “噢～” 或者 “哇～”。不过超过这个长度的评论还是需要自重的。"

        "Chinese": "和男孩的抱怨相反，电影很快就进入了正题——至少从麻美的过时标准来看是如此。唯一的停顿是让观众们选择是否同意电影院调整他们的头部角度。麻美选择了同意，准备按照导演选定的视角来体验这部电影。"

        "English": "It was raining, and she could hear raindrops hitting an umbrella above her.\nShe heard the panting breath of a running woman, heard the taps of footfalls on pavement, and her view shook slightly, advancing down the street. Mami realized that she was *in* the perspective of the running woman.",
        "Chinese": "然后麻美感到自己正在低头看着一条破旧的马路。路上铺着老式的石化沥青。马路周围的建筑显得颇为荒废。天上下着雨，她能听到雨滴打在伞面上的声音。\n她听到了女人跑步的喘气声和马路上传来的脚步声。视野一边抖动一边沿路前进。麻美意识到她正在看着跑步女人本人的视野。"

        "English": "The woman looked back up, and seemed to be getting tired—she was definitely slowing down, and the panting was getting heavier—but was approaching her destination, the back door of an impressive‐looking stained glass church, well‐maintained and bright compared to the surroundings. On the sign, partly hidden, the name of the city could be barely read: Tokyo.",
        "Chinese": "女人重新抬起了视线，显得有些疲累——她的速度慢了下来，而喘息声变得更加粗重。但目的地已经近在眼前了：一座天主教堂的后门。教堂倒是颇为干净气派，在周围的破旧建筑衬托之下，让人不禁眼前一亮。门牌半隐半现，只能隐约辨认出 “东京” 二字。"

        "English": "\"I'm sorry,\" she said.\nFinally, the perspective changed, and instead of being the women, she turned her head left to watch the back of the woman as she ran away through the rain, weeping. She had the distinct feeling of lying on her back.",
        "Chinese": "“对不起。” 她说。\n最后，镜头切换。麻美发现自己向左看着女人的背影，隐约感到有雨点打在背上。女人呜咽着逃进了雨中。"

Homura had never clearly explained to any of them how her parents had ended up leaving her in the care of a nunnery, and Mami suspected Homura didn't really know anything about it either. Mami had never even been sure if Homura was really an orphan.",
        "Chinese": "画面淡出。\n这场景很感人，麻美想。但是编得有些过了。焰从没跟她们解释过为什么她的父母要把她扔在修道院，而且麻美觉得她自己其实也什么都不知道。这还没有考虑到父母早逝的情况，虽说焰没有这么提起过吧。"

        "Chinese": "接着，影片回顾了焰在孤儿院的童年生活，以及修道院的严苛规矩和宗教课程。童年的焰安静，内向而勤勉。她和小伙伴们玩耍，也有自己的朋友，似乎一切都和旁人一样，但仍然显得和周围的一切若即若离。"

That would be silly and uncomfortable. It only moved your head when necessary. Audiences nowadays were used to mostly not moving on their own, though.",

For instance, Homura hadn't been quite *that* bad with her powers initially, and she certainly had never gotten airsickness while trying to fly. Also, while the movie made a big deal of Homura discovering her most valuable power, the real Homura had known what hers was right off the bat. Finally, their school had never come under attack, yet here was a scene with the three of them dramatically slaughtering demons while working to make sure the miasma prevented them from being noticed.",

The scene was flagrantly fictional, and had never even come close to happening. This time, it wasn't because the writers didn't know, or because they were dramatizing, or because of censorship—it was because Kyouko, Mami, and Yuma had all lied through their teeth.",
        "Chinese": "麻美点头的意思并不是在赞赏这一段的真实性。事实上，这个故事从头到尾都是瞎编的，在真实世界里完全没有发生的可能。造成这种状况的原因并不是因为缺乏信息、过度夸张、或者是为了通过审核——真正的原因是杏子、麻美和由真事先串通好，一致提供了虚假情报。\n她点头是因为这个谎言已经开始向公众扩散了。"

        "English": "The scene now was Mami's apartment, again, but different. The room obviously belonged to the same owner, but the furniture was in different places, and the location of the doors had changed. It was, Mami knew, the filmmakers' way of hinting what she knew—that a few years after high school graduation, they had all been obliged to move.",
        "Chinese": "这背后自然有种种原因。一个问题是邻居们开始逐渐对麻美小姐和她奇怪的朋友们产生怀疑：高中毕业，但是没上大学、没有工作、也没有男朋友。房间一天到晚都有不同的女孩进进出出，但从来见不到她们的家人。"
    },
    {
        "English": "It had been a combination of reasons. Partly, it was prompted by the sense that the neighbors were starting to get too suspicious of Mami‐san and her strange friends, who had graduated school but showed no signs of a job, or boyfriends, or college—too suspicious of the girls who came and went at all times of day, and who appeared not to have any family.",
        "Chinese": "压垮她们的最后一根稻草是她们的隔壁邻居——一位善于照顾别人的好大婶。这天晚上，大婶到阳台上透气，然后发现隔壁的阳台上，杏子身受重伤，正被麻美抱在怀里。杏子腹部的伤口只是用缎带简单地捆了一下，还在不停地往外流血。"

        "Chinese": "大婶出现的时机很是不巧——麻美刚从房顶上跳下阳台，而由真和焰也是则刚从城市的另一头狩猎返回。那时已经来不及采取什么行动了，而且第一要务毕竟还是先把杏子治好，而不是跟目击证人解释什么。"
    },
    {
        "English": "It had been terrible timing—Mami had just landed a jump from the ceiling and Yuma had been with Homura in another part of the city, and had only just then got back—but there was nothing that could be done, and it was more important to get Kyouko healed than to try to talk to the woman next door.",
        "Chinese": "麻美仍然记得那天晚上大婶脸上的惊讶表情。但她当时的反应只是说了句 “别告诉别人”，然后就把杏子抱进了屋里。"
    },

        "English": "Mami still remembered the wide‐eyed look on the woman's face when Mami told her to \"tell *no one*\" as she carried Kyouko in.",
        "Chinese": "这种情况下，大婶显然是要告诉别人的。虽然麻美特意跑过去求了她一趟，但她还是坚持着没有取消那个紧急呼叫。最后，当救急医疗队和警察赶来的时候，他们看见的是床上睡着的杏子和一旁慌张的由真，但杏子睡得很稳，身上已经没有明显的伤口了。一旁的麻美和焰则在笨拙地擦拭着地板上的血迹——她俩的魔法技能在这种清洁工作上都不怎么管用。"
    },
    {
        "English": "But of course, she told someone, even when Mami went next door and implored her to cancel the emergency call, and the paramedics and police arrived just in time to find Kyouko asleep with Yuma fussing over her, but with no obvious wounds, and to find Mami and Homura in the middle of trying to remove blood stains from the floor—because none of them had any magical skills particularly useful for cleaning.",
        "Chinese": "最后她们编了个颇为荒诞的借口，勉强混过了警察的盘问。但显然这里已经住不下去了。"

        "English": "Posing as her own mother, Homura rented a new room elsewhere in the city, and they spent two weeks carrying all of their possessions to the new location—the furniture flown over in the dead of night by Homura. They kept themselves shut in as much as possible, so that hopefully no one would notice that they seemed to be getting progressively younger.",
        "Chinese": "最后某一天，她们悄然离开了原来的住所，并且在不改变身份和不离开地盘的前提下尽量清除掉了自己的一切痕迹。在进入新住处的时候，她们又变回了十来岁少女的外貌，既是为了防止被认出来，也是为了利用新邻居们的同情。"
    },
    {
        "English": "Finally, one day, they left, suddenly and abruptly, leaving behind as little of a trail as they could manage without outright changing identities or leaving their territory. They arrived at their new location teenagers again, to throw off anyone who might recognize them, and so that they could exploit the sympathies of their neighbors.",

        "Chinese": "直说的话，就是钱的问题。她们都没有收入来源。教会在焰二十岁时断了她的生活费。麻美家人留下的钱虽然不少，但同时供养四个人也开始显得拮据。她们尝试过在商店街打打工什么的，但是她们最后还是渐渐沦落到了要靠杏子抢劫取款机来维持生活的地步。她们完全无法维持一份稳定的工作——需要不定期地离开岗位和魔兽作战，无法保证按时睡眠，外表年龄和户籍不符……"

    {
        "English": "Frankly put, it was money. None of them had a source—the Church had stopped supporting Homura at twenty, and Mami's family funds, though substantial, were starting to strain to support all four of them. They took part‐time jobs at grocery stores and the like, but they were becoming deplorably reliant on Kyouko's regular ATM robberies. It simply wasn't possible to take a steadier job—not with the constant need to leave to fight demons, the irregular sleep schedules, the inconsistent ages…",

We all see the benefits of cooperation, and we agreed yesterday on the details of how it would work, but there's another enticing possibility we have yet to go over that I want to cover.\"",
        "Chinese": "“作为最后的议程，” 焰说，吸引了在场所有魔法少女的注意力，“我有个还没讲到的问题想和大家讨论一下。未必要有具体结果，只是提供一些思路。这些天大家已经看到了彼此合作能够带来的种种好处，昨天我们也已经敲定了主要的实行细节。但我还有个大有希望的想法没来得及说——”\n那是一个特殊的周末。见泷原四人组召集了市区和近郊另外五个魔法少女组合的代表，一起开会讨论合作计划。一直以来努力做出的友善姿态，基于私人关系的合作尝试，加上魔兽大爆发时的共同作战，种种因素将近十年的积累，终于让她们走到了现在这一步。"

This planning meeting was the culmination of nearly a decade of conciliatory gestures, tentative friendship meetings, and joint fights against demon concentrations.",

They held plates with chocolate cake and crackers, as well as cups full of tea. Homura was gesturing at a presentation shone onto the surface by a brand‐new holoprojector. From a perch on a nearby counter, Kyubey watched passively, implicitly blessing the proceedings; he had already done so explicitly earlier.",

        "English": "\"The primary thing stopping us from getting real jobs is the constant emergencies we can't explain to anyone,\" Homura said, stretching out her hand to point at the slide. \"It's one thing ditching school—it's another ditching a job.

        "Chinese": "但是这些都没能起到什么实质作用。\n防御平台和太空船只是在外星舰队的阵列上打出了一个小坑。而驻军和平民们的努力作战也只拖延了它们几天的时间。外星人还是故意没有进行任何的轨道轰炸。"

They would expend surprising effort to eliminate an infant, then ignore the adults in the vicinity. Or they would kill three people in a group of four, and ignore the fourth even if the fourth happened to be firing in their direction. It followed no pattern anyone could discern.",
        "Chinese": "不过这次，它们开始认真地选择攻击对象，而不是随意开火了——虽然它们的行为逻辑仍然显得不可理喻。它们有时会大费周章地杀死一个婴儿但放过一旁的大人。或者杀死四人小队里面的三个人，然后放过第四个，尽管最后那个人一直在朝它们开火。没有任何人能从中找到什么规律。"

        "Chinese": "这也是一种技术手段。按照麻美的亲身体验，在每一名参与者自己的视角里，她都处于剧场中最好的座位上。而且实际参会的人数远大于现实中任何一座剧场的最大容量，这就是虚拟现实。行会的技术人员帮助成员们规避了执政体的相关限制。"

What had happened *first* was that the Leadership Committee had debated the issues around a virtual table, with the membership in quiet observation, and anyone wishing to speak materializing in front of them. Then the Committee had voted to submit the extraordinary measure for general approval, and it had passed with ninety‐six percent approval. *Then* Homura had given a speech.",

We use railguns and use lasers only when we can spare the power, while *they* fire freely. *Their* armor has personal forcefields, which we don't even *understand.* Their drones are smarter than ours, their stealth better, their armor stronger, their ships faster. And on top of all of that, we can't mobilize soldiers fast enough to match their numbers. If we let our pathetic military defend us, how long until the aliens come to *your world*? How long until they come to *Earth?*\"",
