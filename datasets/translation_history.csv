"By the time Mami reached the theatre, she had changed her entire appearance.","当麻美走到电影院的时候，她的样子已经和刚才完全不同了。"
"Most of the disguise was quite trivial. It was simple to ask her hair to drop down into a relaxed conformation—she was extremely thankful she no longer had to do her hair every morning—simple to transform her soul gem into a less standard bracelet, and also simple to dismiss her *personal* transport in a secluded area and instead board a civilian‐standard model.","她的伪装其实很简单。给头发下指令将发型改为自然下垂——不用亲手做头发真是爽——把灵魂宝石变形成一种比较少见的手镯形态，然后把自己的专车停在一个隐蔽地点，换乘一辆标准民用车。"
"If only she could grab a hooded coat out of a clothing supplier and then be done with it.","要是能够套一件连帽大衣解决问题就完美了。"
"Unfortunately, in this age of ubiquitous facial recognition, that simply wouldn't be enough.","可惜，在人脸识别大行其道的当下，连帽大衣已经成为历史了。"
"Thus, she was obliged to walk into the theatre with a miniature holoemitter stuck to the side of her cheek, one capable of distorting her appearance to that of someone else who lived in the area, someone who vaguely resembled the famous Marshal Mami, but obviously wasn't. Another one stuck to her finger concealed the tell‐tale flower fingernail mark.","所以，在走到电影院的路上，她往脸上粘了一个微型全息投影仪，借此把自己的外貌扭曲成了一个住在附近的其他人——长得有点像著名的麻美元帅，但明显不是本人。粘在手指上的另一个投影仪隐藏了花朵型的指甲纹——另一个明显的魔法少女标志。"
"It was widely known that the government granted exceptions to the regulations against identity disguise, but that didn't make her disguise any less effective. Sure, she wouldn't fool any of the surveillance monitors, but it was more than sufficient to mislead the casual inspection of passerby. And the monitors knew not to attract anyone's attention to her.","很多人都知道她持有执政体颁发的个人身份伪装许可，但这并不影响这种扮装的效果。这种程度显然骗不过监控摄像头，但是用来误导路人们不经意的视线已经足够了。摄像头们当然也很知趣，不会随便拆穿她。"
"She had considered showing up dressed for the occasion, picturing herself stepping out of the nighttime lights into the brightness of the theatre in a stunning dress, and wearing the face of someone *particularly* attractive, but in the end had decided against it. Turning heads in her direction would be risky, even if she had an urge to have people do it for reasons other than "It's Mami‐san!"","她也考虑过，要不要选个漂亮点儿的脸，再换件衣服。她想象了一下自己身着华服从昏暗的街灯下步入灯火通明的电影院的感觉，最后还是放弃了。虽然她很希望偶尔能用 “这是麻美！” 以外的理由吸引到路人回头，但这种引人注目的行动太冒险了。"
"Besides, other than being puerile by trying to grab attention, what would be the point? She had stayed relationship‐free her entire life—a number of years she didn't like to think about—and didn't see it as a good idea to change that anytime soon.","反正，这也就能满足一下自己幼稚的表现欲吧？她一辈子都没有谈过恋爱——她已经不敢计算具体的年份数字了——而且现在也不打算改变这一点。"
